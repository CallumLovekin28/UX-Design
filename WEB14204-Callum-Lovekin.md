### Introduction

This project was about creating a digital product or service that helped make people aware of their filter bubble or help burst it. We could design anything from an app to a browser plugin. During this project, I learned a lot about how to use UX software such as sketch and also how to test a prototype and to implement the feedback gathered from it.

![Idea](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/UX-Design/blob/master/Images/Concept.png)

My Idea for this project was to create a browser plug-in that enabled people to see what is going on around the world. I wanted to create something that was easy to use but also opened a lot of peoples eyes. I tested it and the idea on a few people and got feedback throughout the project to iterate it.

I wanted to aim it towards people who use social media as there primary news source and create a plugin that they could use as a bit of fun but also be educational. My project was designed with the intention to burst peoples location filter bubble.
